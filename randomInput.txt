As Elton John said: ' I am the most well-known homosexual in the world '.
This is a comprehensive test for the go-reloaded project.
Let's start with some simple cases: It's a beautiful day (up, 2).
Now for some numbers: 1A (hex) and 1010 (bin).
And some mixed cases: this is a SENTENCE (low, 2) to test with.
Let's try some punctuation: 'this is a quote' ... and some more text.
Here is a tricky one: a (up) honest man, with a (cap) apple.
And now for a really long one: 
' a (up) amazing (low) story (cap) about 
a (up) honest (low) man (cap) ' (up, 10) ... and some more text.
Let's see how it handles invalid modifiers: 
this is a (invalid) test.
And modifiers at the beginning: (cap) this should not be capitalized.
Finally, let's put it all together:
' a (up) amazing (low) story (cap) about a (up) honest (low)
 man (cap) ' (up, 10) ... and some more text, with 1A (hex)
  and 1010 (bin) and a (invalid) modifier.
This is a test with multiple spaces    between words.
And a sentence with a lot of punctuation marks ! ? . , : ;
Let's test a/an with a capitalized word: a Apple.
And with an uppercased word: a AMAZING story.
This is the end of the test.
